					<p>Once there lived a good English family in a small village. But they never celebrated
					Halloween. One Halloween night they sat round the table and prepared to have a special food. And suddenly
					they heard a low voice — yyyyeeehhhhaaa! They looked — it was a ghost! They didn’t believe their eyes but it
					was there. With screams they ran away to their neighbors and when they went back they saw, that ghosts ate
					every sweet thing from the table and on the chairs there sat three happy boys with white sheets in their
					hands.</p>

					<p>A girl in a pretty white dress and embroidered sweater flags down an old man for a ride.
					He gives her a ride to her great-grandmother’s house and they have a lovely conversation, talking about the
					old days, and the elderly man shares some great stories with her. He drops her off at her geema’s house and
					he goes home. The following day when he gets into his car to pick up some milk and the paper, he realises
					the sweater is still in his car. He swings by the young girl’s geema’s house to drop off the sweater, and
					her geema answers the door. He explains why he’s there. «I’m sorry Sir. I think you have the wrong address.
					My great-granddaughter died many, many years ago, wearing her favourite white dress, after a night out
					dancing.»</p>

					<p>Once upon a time, a man and a boy who had lost their wife and mother moved into a new
					house. They were told by the locals in the village that the house was haunted, but neither the man nor the
					boy believed in ghosts, and they moved into the house quite happily. The child went downstairs and asked the
					maid of the home for a glass of water and some fruit, and she happily obliged. She also told the boy that
					there could be ghosts. Later that day, the little boy struck up a conversation with his father. «Daddy, I’ve
					been thinking. I could believe in ghosts. The maid told me there might be ghosts in the house.» «Son, we
					don’t have a maid».</p>
